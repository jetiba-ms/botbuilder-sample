## Samples

**ReservationBot**

For the development of this bot it is used an abstraction, built on top of the Bot Builder v4. [Here](https://github.com/cmayomsft/promptly-dotnet) you can find more information. Please notice that **this is not an official solution**, but a personal/experimental solution to prompt user for input (Promptly-dotnet) and manage the conversation flow (topics).
See also the documentation about how to manage the conversation flow with [dialogs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-dialog-manage-conversation-flow?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp) (*Coming soon*: the same solution using dialogs)

Other used features:
* [DateTimeRecognizer APIs](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recognizers-Text/tree/master/.NET) 
* [Adaptive Cards](http://adaptivecards.io/visualizer/)
